## Installation ##
- iverilog
- mac
# brew install icarus-verilog



iverilog (check RTL design)
- write synthesizable code: design.v
- write testbench code: testbench.v
- compile (creates vvp file)
    $ iverilog -o testbench.vvp testbench.v
- run vvp (creates vcd file)
    $ vvp testbench.vvp
- view waveform
    $ gtkwave   // then select signal and append

yosys (logic sythesize)
- sequence
    $ yosys
    yosys> read_verilog design.v
    yosys> techmap      // map the design to default technology
    yosys> opt          // optimize the design
    yosys> show         // show the synthesized result
- note: fundamental building block (e.g. NOT gate) are called "cells". Rarely need to look into it.
